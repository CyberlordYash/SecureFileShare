## Overview

The Secure File Share Spring Boot application is designed to allow users to safely upload, download, and manage files. It implements strong security measures to ensure data confidentiality and integrity, making it ideal for organizations that require secure file exchange and storage.

## Features

- **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure login and role-based access control using Spring Security.
- **File Upload/Download:** Efficient handling of large file transfers with support for multiple file types.
- **Data Encryption:** Files are encrypted at rest and during transit.
- **RESTful API:** Well-documented endpoints for integrating with other services.
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Integrated logging for tracking system activity and security auditing.
- **Scalability:** Modular architecture designed for easy expansion and integration with other microservices.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling and user-friendly error messages.

## Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture:
- **Presentation Layer:** REST controllers handle HTTP requests.
- **Service Layer:** Business logic is implemented here, ensuring separation of concerns.
- **Repository Layer:** Data access is managed via Spring Data JPA with an underlying relational database.
- **Security Layer:** Utilizes Spring Security to handle authentication, authorization, and protection against common threats.
  
Diagrams and further architectural details are available in the [docs](docs/Architecture.md) folder.
